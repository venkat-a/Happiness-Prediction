# Machine Learning Model Selection and Tuning

This repository # f2jZd474bSyeUsM0 contains Python code for selecting, tuning, and evaluating machine learning models on a dataset. The code utilizes popular machine learning algorithms and techniques for parameter tuning to improve model performance. The models included in this repository are:

1. XGBoost Classifier
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Gradient Boosting Classifier
4. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
5. Logistic Regression

## Dataset

The code uses a dataset from ACME Corporation's Happiness Survey 2020 (ACME-HappinessSurvey2020.csv) for training and testing the machine learning models. The dataset consists of features and a target variable 'Y' representing happiness levels.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-model-selection.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries. You can use the following command to install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts for each model. The code is organized into separate blocks for each model, allowing you to choose and run a specific model of interest.

4. The code performs the following steps for each model:
   - Data preprocessing, including feature scaling.
   - Stratified K-Fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
   - Training the final model with the best hyperparameters.
   - Evaluating the model's accuracy on a test dataset.

5. After running the code for each model, you can compare the validation and test accuracies to assess model performance.

## Results

The results of the model selection and tuning process are provided in the form of accuracy scores for each model on the test dataset. Additionally, the code generates a bar chart to visualize the comparison of validation and test accuracies among different models.
